I have explored this dataset previously and did some analysis and visuliztions in Python_Visualization_Exercise repository.

Since we have a great dataset with a lot of features. I think it's a good start to use it for machine learning. 

As mentioned in "dataset info.txt", who provided this dataset wanted to figure out what caused their best and most experienced employees' leavings. One column in the dataset indicates whether the employee has left, so this would be a classification problem. I will try to play with this dataset using some classification models, hopefully including all of the following classic ones:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- KNN
- SVM

Some other models I want to explore later are:
- Neural Network
- Random Forest
- ...

Let's start.
